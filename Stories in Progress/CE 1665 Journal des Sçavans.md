### Extra Info

## Unformed Thoughts

This seems to be a precedent to the Royal Society's *Philosophical Transactions*. It would be a good example as to how long we have been doing peer-review for (save Al-Ruhawi's "local council"), as well as publishing via academic journals.

Much to learn and figure out!

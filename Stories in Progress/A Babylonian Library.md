### Extra Info
The first library-like institution seems to be a Babylonian temple. The temple – dating back to the first half of the third millenium BCE and located in the southeast of modern-day Iraq – was filled with clay tablets (Francis et al., [2017](https://www.britannica.com/topic/library/The-history-of-libraries)). It is difficult to see a distinction between archives that contain records and “libraries” proper, in antiquity. But the idea of a building – an institution – for the compilation of information and, ultimately, sources of knowledge, survives throughout any narrative of the history of libraries.

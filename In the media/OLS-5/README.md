**This folder tracks the learnings and projects conducted during my time with OLS-5. This folder goes beyond what is captured by the [OLS-5 repo](https://github.com/open-life-science/ols-5/issues/3). The OLS-5 cohort took mw in following the abstract captured [here](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/An_Incomplete_History_of_Research_Ethics/blob/main/In%20the%20media/Abstracts.md#ols-5-application).**

Following the mentoring meeting with [@Lisanna](https://github.com/Lisanna) on week 05, I want to workshop an onboarding session to give the newly-created [Protocol 11](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/An_Incomplete_History_of_Research_Ethics/blob/main/Protocols.md#Protocol-11-Networking-at-the-Agora) some "empirical foundation," so to speak.

To make recognition as clear as possible, I have created [Contributors.md](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/An_Incomplete_History_of_Research_Ethics/blob/main/Contributors.md).

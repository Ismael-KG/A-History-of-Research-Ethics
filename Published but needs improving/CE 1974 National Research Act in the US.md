### Extra Info

Amongst other things, the National Research Act called for a regulated “institutional review board” process. This process allows for the ethical appraisal and approval of research conducted by US institutions that apply for funding for research that “involves the conduct of biomedical or behavioral research involving human subjects” (Public Law 93-348, [1974](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-88/pdf/STATUTE-88-Pg342.pdf): 352).

### Extra Info

Related to the spread of technologies that allow for easier sharing of data, legislation has become more sophisticated in its defence of individuals’ privacy. One major piece of modern legislation is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in place in the European Union since May 2018. The GDPR introduced important changes in relation to Data Protection Directive of 1995. For example, its territorial reach is greater than previous regulations, as it protects the privacy of EU citizens regardless of the residence of a data collector. The GDPR also provides an expanded definition of “sensitive personal data,” which now includes biometric data such as retina scans and fingerprints.

### Extra Info

the Greek historian Megasthenes wrote about the “Royal Highway” in the 4th century BCE, a great trade route from eastern India which intersected with another two – one from Kashmir and the other from western Asia – at TakshaShila, located in modern-day Pakistan ([Puri, 2021](https://www.britannica.com/place/Taxila)). And here, we find signs of the world’s first university ([History of Ayurveda, n.d.a](https://www.historyofayurveda.org/library/ancient-university-takshashila); see also [Bolzon, 2020](https://beyond.britannica.com/who-is-the-founder-of-taxila-university-of-ancient-india)). Established in the 5th century BCE, the university thrived until the 6th century CE.

### Extra Info

With the rise of big data analytics, where data science is applied to ever-larger datasets, the risk of making serious – even life-changing – inferences based on data is increasing. The California Consumer Privacy Act – in effect since January 2020 (Paul, [2019](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/30/california-consumer-privacy-act-what-does-it-do)) – features definitions of inference and explicit protections for inferred data. Jordan ([2020](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3518164)) argues that these give the CCPA an advantage before a GDPR that is less clear on the protection of inferred data.

### Extra Info

The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) defines copyright as follows:

“Copyright (or author’s right) is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works. Works covered by copyright range from books, music, paintings, sculpture, and films, to computer programs, databases, advertisements, maps, and technical drawings” (WIPO, [n.d.](https://www.wipo.int/copyright/en/)).

Thanks to the Berne Convention of 1886 and its subsequent revisions, a work’s copyright status requires no formalities and is internationally recognised.

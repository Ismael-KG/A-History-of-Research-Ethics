### Extra Info

The idea underlying intersectionality was by no means discovered by Crenshaw. King ([1988](https://doi.org/10.1086/494491)) tells us of the “double jeopardy” already described by black women at the start of the 20th century. Since Crenshaw coined the term, though, it has evolved and gained both supporters and detractors (see Dhamoon, [2011](http://www.jstor.org/stable/41058336), for a discussion of different readings of “intersectionality”).

Intersectionality has become a key term in all works of life, from the workplace (e.g. Reosette et al., [2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.riob.2018.12.002)) to activism and academic research (e.g. Moradi & Grzanka, [2017](https://doi.org/10.1037/cou0000203)). This means that the phenomenon of intersectionality has become both an object of inquiry and a mode of inquiry.

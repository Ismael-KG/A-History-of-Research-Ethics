### Extra Info

The response to what the Nazis called “science” was the Nuremburg Code ([1947](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.313.7070.1448)), which captured ten “basic principles [that] must be observed in order to satisfy moral, ethical and legal concepts” ([ibid.](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.313.7070.1448); see [USHMM](https://www.ushmm.org/information/exhibitions/online-exhibitions/special-focus/doctors-trial/nuremberg-code)). Amongst these principles, we find the need for research subjects’ “voluntary consent,” which reinforces what we’d seen as “autonomy” in the previous section. The Nuremburg Code also states that the aim of experimentation be “to yield fruitful results for the good of society” ([ibid.](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.313.7070.1448)).

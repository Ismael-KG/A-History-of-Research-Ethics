### Extra Info

Amongst other practices, this book advocates for physicians to produce duplicate notes for their review. This review would be conducted “by a local council of physicians, who would adjudicate as to whether the physician had performed according to the standards that then prevailed” (Al-Mousawi, [2020](https://blog.f1000.com/2020/01/31/a-brief-history-of-peer-review/)).

Importantly, this amounts to a governance structure, “a local council of physicians” who would review medical notes. The process is a mechanism to ensure that doctors are conducting themselves correctly. What’s more, there is mention in Al-Mousawi’s quote of adhering to “the standards that then prevailed” (ibid.). This responds to the same need: there are a set of standards to follow if one wants to be a good physician. These standards seem to align with Hippocrates’ talk of “knowledge and skills”. The difference now is that Al-Ruhawi has suggested a process whereby these knowledge and skills might be put in check.

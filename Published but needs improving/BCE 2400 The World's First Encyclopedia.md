### Extra Info

The work put into transcribing the ancient tablet for the modern world took ninety years and resulted in The Assyrian Dictionary of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago ([Roth et al., 2010](https://oi.uchicago.edu/research/publications/assyrian-dictionary-oriental-institute-university-chicago-cad)).

The distinction between dictionaries and encyclopedias makes little sense at this point in history. However, the spirit of preserving knowledge in a format for others to access – even millenia into the future –is certainly relatable.

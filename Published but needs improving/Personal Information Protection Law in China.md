### Extra Info

The GDPR continues to be a strong benchmark for the development of new data protection regulations. China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), in effect since November 2021, draws on various definitions from the GDPR. Amongst them, we have consent, which must be informed and given freely and through clear action, and can be withdrawn. However, Ke et al. note a difference in this respect:

“[…] The PIPL requires a separate consent for certain processing activities, namely if a processing entity (i) shares personal information with other processing entities; (ii) publicly discloses personal information; (iii) processes sensitive personal information; or (iv) transfers personal information overseas (Articles 23, 25, 29 and 39)” (Ke et al., [2021](https://iapp.org/news/a/analyzing-chinas-pipl-and-how-it-compares-to-the-eus-gdpr/)).

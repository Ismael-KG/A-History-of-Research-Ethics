### Extra Info

The concept of academic freedom is relatively modern. Its spirit can be traced back to the University of Göttingen (Anderson, [2004: 58](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.003.0004)), established in 1734, where “scientific research was freed from censorship by the church […], and […] academic teaching was given high priority” (Böhme, [n.d.](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/history+of+the+university+%E2%80%93+an+overview/90607.html); see also Meetzger, [1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40221079)).

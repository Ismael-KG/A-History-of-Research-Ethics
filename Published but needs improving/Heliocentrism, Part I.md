### Extra Info

Heliocentrism is the theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun and not the other way round.

Copernicus had his theory published after his death, in 1543. This was a tactical maneouvre on his part, as the Catholic Church would not have approved of a theory of the universe without the Earth at its centre.

Indeed, the book was later banned by the Church in 1616. This also relates to [Galileo Galilei's condemnation by the Church](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443500!) in 1633.

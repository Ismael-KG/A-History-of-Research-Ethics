### Extra Info

Epistemic injustice is constituted by testimonial injustice – whereby a speaker receives an unfair deficit of credibility because of prejudices held by an interlocutor’s part – and hermeneutical injustice – whereby someone has a significant area of their social experience obscured from understanding owing to prejudicial flaws in shared resources for social interpretation.

### Extra Info

Akademische Freiheit (academic freedom) captures Humboldt’s twin concepts of Lehrfreiheit (freedom to teach) – teachers’ right to teach about the research they were free to pursue – and Lernfreiheit (freedom to learn) – students’ right to choose what to study (Dea, [2018](https://www.universityaffairs.ca/opinion/dispatches-academic-freedom/a-brief-history-of-academic-freedom/)). The “Humboldtian model” of universities further proposed the unity of teaching and research, the educational ideal of Bildung (“education”) based on a neo-humanist admiration for ancient Greece, and corporate autonomy for universities (Anderson, [2004](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198206606.003.0004)).

Academic freedom entails the responsibility of employers towards their researchers. Consider Dea's argument that, "if engaging with the public is indeed part of the job of the professor, then universities ought to protect professors who take up the task". Much like the Royal Society seeking to enable a scientific culture around "Nullius in verba," it falls to universities and research institutes' governance structures to allow academics to pursue knowledge with freedom. However, this is not to disregard the fraught nature of the concept.

### Extra Info

In May 1609, Galilei learned of spyglasses that could magnify objects by two or three times their original size - the first telescopes, which had been patented in the Netherlands the year before (American Physical Society, [2001](https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200105/history.cfm)). By October 1609, Galilei had managed to build a telescope that magnified objects by twenty times. He then took to observing the movements of celestial bodies.

By March the following year, Galilei published "Sidereus Nuncius," the first book with empirical evidence for Copernicus' heliocentrism. Whilst well-rewarded by his employer (ibid.) - the University of Padua, in Italy - the Roman Catholic Church was not so pleased.

In 1616, Pope Paul V placed Copernicus' book on the "Index Librorum Prohibitorum" - Index of Prohibited Books - (San Diego State University Library, [2020](https://library.sdsu.edu/banned-books-2020)). This became a precursor to the complicated relationship between Galilei and the Roman Catholic Church.

Eventually, Galilei was summoned before the Roman Inquisition in 1633. He argued that he had only unintentionally defended heliocentrism. The trial cost him his last years of freedom, as he was condemned, at the age of 69, to house arrest.

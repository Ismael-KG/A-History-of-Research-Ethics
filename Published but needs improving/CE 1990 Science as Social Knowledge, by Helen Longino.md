### Extra Info

Researchers are not immune to prevalent belief systetems when in the lab. We noted this in early-twentieth century eugenics. We also find this idea convincingly argued by Longino in her book Science as Social Knowledge (1990). Longino explains idea that scientific hypotheses can be subjected to critique on the basis of the background assumptions that uphold them. Scientific hypotheses, in other words, can be grounded on researchersâ€™ beliefs. Critiquing these beliefs should be part of the scientific process, Longino argues.

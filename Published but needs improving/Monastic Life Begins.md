### Extra Info

As Corwin ([2016](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/ancientbooks/2016/05/24/medieval-book-production-and-monastic-life/)) puts it:

"It wasnâ€™t until the fourth century AD that the Medieval world was introduced to monastic life, in the form of a devout Egyptian Christian named Pachomius that thought it was a good idea to have an isolated space to be humbly miserable and to worship God at the same time. His concept spread rapidly throughout the Eastern Roman Empire, and with it, his expectation for all monks to be literate."

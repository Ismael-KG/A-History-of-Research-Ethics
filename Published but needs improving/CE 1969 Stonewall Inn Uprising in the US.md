### Extra Info

That “there are two biological genders” has been used as a premise for the subjugation of trans people. The uprising at Stonewall Inn, in 1969 New York, was a fight against this system (Lorenzo, [2019](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/about-us/news/stonewall-uprising-50-years-lgbt-history)).

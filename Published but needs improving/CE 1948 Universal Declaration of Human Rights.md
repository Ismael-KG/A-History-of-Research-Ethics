### Extra Info

In response to World War II quite broadly, world leaders established the United Nations (UN), whereby its members “vowed to never again allow atrocities like those of that conflict to happen again [and] decided to complement the UN Charter with a road map to guarantee the rights of every individual everywhere” (UN, [n.d.](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/udhr/history-of-the-declaration#:~:text=The%20Universal%20Declaration%20of%20Human,of%20the%20Second%20World%20War)). This would become the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.

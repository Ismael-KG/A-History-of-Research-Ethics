### Extra Info

[Rotblat had left the Manhattan Project](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443840!) when he learned the Germans had not taken their nuclear endeavours forward.

On 06 August 1945, one atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. The next was dropped three days later on Nagasaki (History.com Editors, [2021](https://www.history.com/topics/world-war-ii/bombing-of-hiroshima-and-nagasaki).

Whilst the short-term deaths are estimated to be between 150,000 and 240,000, the longer-term impact on human life has been harder to determine, although it seems clear that survivors of the bombings were at much greater risk to developing leukemia (Listwa, [2012](https://k1project.columbia.edu/news/hiroshima-and-nagasaki)).

# A History of Research Ethics
This repository will eventually contain the text for the tiki-toki timeline [*A History of Research Ethics*](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/).

### A brief history of this timeline
I began this as a side-project in [mid-September 2021](https://twitter.com/hermeneuticist/status/1441111868039315462?s=20). As I wrote it, I wondered if it was worth sharing, but I was unsure about getting it through a peer-reviewed journal; besides, I didn't think a lengthy text was the most useful way to learn about the history of research ethics, so I looked for sites to host a free timeline and found [Tiki-Toki](https://www.tiki-toki.com/)! I created an account on 16 October 2021 and uploaded (almost) everything I had written!
Since then, I have realised that tracking changes is very hard. I had been using a document on [Hackmd](hackmd.io) for writing but it got clunky when I tried to track changes. 
So here we are! I will slowly upload the various stories (each event on the timeline) to this repository. I can then also create issues to suggest edits to each story or even new stories!

### Would you like to help?
I would love help from philosophers, historians, lawyers, business professionals, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers!
Github will help trace who made what edits, and we can put authors' names at the bottom of stories they have contributed to.
My big requests to anybody who wishes to contribute are:
* Please use credible sources when making claims. By "credible source," I mean something quite broad and suggest that, whilst Wikipedia provides a great deal of information, use it as a tool for idea-generation and don't be afraid to visit the many references their pages provide. (This is not to say I haven't cited Wikipedia! But if we can explore more deeply, all the better.)
* BE NICE. I don't know if/how I can ban people from using this repository, but any slur, insult or degrading comment will make me send you a lengthy message, if that is even possible. I have no tolerance for people who are not nice. A great deal of what I have written needs a lot of improvement. I wouldn't make this repository public otherwise. But feedback (to myself and others) must be constructive and helpful, and written with nothing but kindness. We are all here to learn!

### The technicalities of Tiki-Toki
There are three major concepts that are worth knowing when discussing Tiki-Toki:
* **Stories:** These are all the panels that appear on the timeline. They can include a "Read More" link at the bottom (I use this for when a panel relates with a specific document online), and an image. It also seems that they can be really quite long! Importantly, they can link to other sites much like how we link sites on Github: by using "{}" with the word/number to link, immediately followed by "()" containing the external site. With the free account, the timeline can host up to 200 stories.
* **Categories:** Stories can only sit within one category, so they must be broad and interpreted rather loosely for the many stories throught the history of researchg ethics. I have set up four so far, and can have up to five with the free account. The four are described in the ["About This Timeline" button at the top-right of the timeline](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/). They are: (1) Opening Up Knowledge; (2) Legislation, Declarations & Frameworks; (3) Improving Research; and (4) Research Tragedies.
* **Tags:** Tags can help navigate stories by theme. A story can have as many tags as you want (out of those created). Once again, I can only have five but have created four and they are described in the ["About This Timeline" button at the top-right of the timeline](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/): (1) How We Do Things, (2) What We Value, (3) Science Influencers, and (4) Bioethics.

The main reason for this repository is to write new stories and track their changes, so it is worth seeing how they are structured. Stories have four main parts:
* **Basic Info:** Here, we have a title, a start and end date (usually the same), an intro (try to keep the intro under 240 characters, like a tweet!), the category (one of the above four), and a link (which is to be used only in case the relevant document/article/book has an official site (for example, a book would link to its publisher's site).
* **Media:** Media are images that appear to the left of stories and make the timeline really pop. Here, you just need a source (a link to an image, ensuring it can be shared; Wikimedia is good for this) and a caption explaining what the image is (I have not seen an option for ALT text, so make sure captions are descriptive).
* **Tags:** There are four to choose from.
* **Extra Info:** This is where the story can be brought to life! This is the longer text thatsome stories already have and which must (1) introduce to importance of the story itself, and (2) link the story to at least one relevant idea in research ethics (broadly construed).

Tiki-Toki is a bit text-heavy, but I find it more intuitive than GitHub (although that's a low bar). But they also have a bunch of [blog posts](https://www.tiki-toki.com/blog/) and [stuff](https://www.tiki-toki.com/faqs/) in case you want to learn more about their platform.

# A-History-of-Research-Ethics
This repository contains the text for the tiki-toki timeline [*A History of Research Ethics*](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/).

### A brief history of this timeline
I began this as a side-project in [mid-September 2021](https://twitter.com/hermeneuticist/status/1441111868039315462?s=20). As I wrote it, I wondered if it was worth sharing, but I was unsure about getting it through a peer-reviewed journal; besides, I didn't think a lengthy text was the most useful way to learn about the history of research ethics, so I looked for sites to host a free timeline and found [Tiki-Toki](https://www.tiki-toki.com/)! I created an account on 16 October 2021 and uploaded (almost) everything I had written!
Since then, I have realised that tracking changes is very hard. I had been using a document on [Hackmd](hackmd.io) for writing but it got clunky when I tried to track changes. 
So here we are! I will slowly upload the various stories (each event on the timeline) to this repository. I can then also create issues to suggest edits to each story or even new stories!

### Would you like to help?
I would love help from philosophers, historians, lawyers, business professionals, butchers, bakers and candlestick makers!
Github will help trace who made what edits, and we can put authors' names at the bottom of stories they have contributed to.
My big requests to anybody who wishes to contribute are:
* Please use credible sources when making claims. By "credible source," I mean something quite broad and suggest that, whilst Wikipedia provides a great deal of information, use it as a tool for idea-generation and don't be afraid to visit the many references their pages provide. (This is not to say I haven't cited Wikipedia! But if we can explore more deeply, all the better.)
* BE NICE. I don't know if/how I can ban people from using this repository, but any slur, insult or degrading comment will make me send you a lengthy message, if that is even possible. I have no tolerance for people who are not nice. A great deal of what I have written needs a lot of improvement. I wouldn't make this repository public otherwise. But feedback (to myself and others) must be constructive and helpful, and written with nothing but kindness. Weare all here to learn.

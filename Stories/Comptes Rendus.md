### Extra Info

The French Académie’s "Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l’Académie des sciences" (“Weekly Accounts of the Meetings of the Academy of Science”; “Comptes Rendus,” for short) was inaugurated as the Académie’s publication in 1835. What pushed the Académie to produce publications was the frustration with journalists harboured over the years. Rather than recount the event, see this excerpt from Duparc’s "Brief history of the publications of the French ‘Académie des sciences’":

“At the beginning of the nineteenth century, the developing bourgeoisie was willing to be regularly informed about technological and scientific progress. Some newspapers tried to give that kind of information. In 1825, a journalist who had access to the written communications provided during the weekly meetings of the ‘Académie’ started to publish informal accounts of these meetings. Georges Cuvier, ‘secrétaire perpétuel’ (permanent secretary) of the Academy for the physics section until his death in 1832, tried to forbid the journalist such an access in 1830 […] because he thought it was almost ‘impossible to summarize in an exact manner the various works of which the Academy is concerned’” (Hardouin Duparc, [2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crhy.2017.10.017): 496).

The same paragraph continues with mention of the professor of mathematics Jacques Frédéric Saigey who wrote for three periodicals and in a critical way. The next permanent secretary, François Arago, banned the periodicals Saigey wrote for from accessing the Academy’s internal meetings. At the same time, Arago suggested the establishment of a publication that would ultimately become the Comptes Rendus in 1835.

With this, Arago acknowledged that publications are a useful way to disseminate scientific findings amongst fellow researchers. The role of the public becomes particularly salient by this brief story. Not only were the developing bourgeoisie interested in the latest science, but journalists were willing to provide this information through their own publications.

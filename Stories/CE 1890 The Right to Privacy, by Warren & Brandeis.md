### The Story
Privacy is a concept that gained traction in US legislation after Warren and Brandeis’ ([1890](https://doi.org/10.2307/1321160)) essay The Right to Privacy. Warren and Brandeis saw technological advancements such as “instantaneous photographs” (ibid.: 195) as a threat to a what Judge Cooley had called the right “to be let alone” (Cooley, [1879](https://repository.law.umich.edu/books/11/)). The core argument they pose is that the legal system already had the provisions to protect individuals’ privacy, but new technology made it important to explicitly recognise this protection as such.

DeCew ([2018](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/privacy/)) provides a thorough history of privacy. For our present purpose, it is important to note that Warren and Brandeis preemted the now frequent clash between technological advances and privacy, whether we are discussing social media platforms, access to health data, or what the UK government has called “cookie fatigue” (Lomas, [2021](https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/06/after-years-of-inaction-against-adtech-uks-ico-calls-for-browser-level-controls-to-fix-cookie-fatigue/)).

### Extra Info

One of the key drivers to develop the atomic bomb was the goal of beating the Nazis to it. However, the news that the Nazis weren’t even close to producing such technology eventually reached the scientists (Douglas, [2018](https://www.frankenbook.org/pub/the-bitter-aftertaste-of-technical-sweetness/release/3)). This was enough for one of the team’s physicists, Rotblat, to abandon the mission. The remaining scientists continued, though. They successfully overcame the technical challenges of developing the atomic bomb.

Following the news from Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 ([skip here](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16464996!) for the final panel of this research tragedy), “none escaped a sense of responsibility for their work” (ibid.).

### The Story
In the Tuskagee syphilis study, researchers observed the evolution of untreated syphilis in black men. The study began in 1932, a time when – as we saw earlier on – eugenics had permeated scientific inquiry. The US Public Health Service, which led the project, was particularly subject to racist ideologies. Indeed, they had been – at different stages – a military organisation (Parascandola, [2001](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/LHC-publications/PDF/pub2001060.pdf)). As Park ([2017](https://doi.org/10.13081/kjmh.2017.26.545)) argues, the military status of the US Public Health Service meant that the US army’s experiences of medical experiments abroad became a part of the country’s attitude to public health.

Informed consent was not collected from the project participants. The study was , the study lasted from 1932 to 1972, and the participants with syphilis were not treated in the 1940s when penicillin was the treatment of choice and widely available (CDC, [2021](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm)). The study’s methodology clearly reflected the pseudoscientific and racist beliefs underpinning eugenics and society more broadly.

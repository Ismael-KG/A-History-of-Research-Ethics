Language is hard, and the history of knowledge draws on it quite a bit of it. Sometimes, the most relevant terms are in a foreign language and, more often than not, they are from a different era. With that, the concepts and conceptions they point to can be enitrely alien to us.

I am still working on this glossary and it will inevitably grow as The Timeline grows. Hopefully, the terms here will help understand some of the tricky games that language plays on us.

## Stories to add
<!-- List any stories that should be added, and provide a short explanation as to why each is relevant. Below is an example list of new stories for the theme "coined terms." -->

* "Res Ipsa Loquitur," a term coined in 1863, as per Fridman ([1954](https://doi.org/10.2307/824843): 233). It is a legal term that has affected how we assign fault, so it is very relevant to responsibility. Consider also Casey ([2019](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3327673)) speaking of "robot ipsa loquitur."
* "Bioethics," coined in 1927 by Jahr (Sass, [2007](https://doi.org/10.1353/ken.2008.0006), an extremely important concept and a useful conception that renders bioethics a discipline by its own right.

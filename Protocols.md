# Protocol 1: Code of Conduct
## Code of Conduct
A key purpose of _A History of Research Ethics_ is to demonstrate the variety of disciplines and backgrounds that can help gain a richer notion of research ethics. Whilst this "richness" needs spelling out, this is not the place for that. This is the place where we note the pernicious aspects of human nature, which become particularly salient when we encounter voices we are not accustomed to and perspectives that differ from our own in areas we are especially passionate about. The necessity for diversity in a project such as _A History of Research Ethics_ can result in clashes or conflicts. This code will continue to be improved, but it sets out two things: (i) expected behaviours when contributing to the present repository, and (ii) methods for resolution.
### Expected behaviours
Participating in discussions on the present repository means adhering to the following principles, adapted from All European Academies ([2011](https://allea.org/portfolio-item/the-european-code-of-conduct-for-research-integrity-2/)):
* _Honesty_ in engaging with views and interpretations that differ from our own, and in providing evidence to argue for one's position.
* _Humility_ relates to honesty insofar that we must be honest with our own limitations. Contributors to _The Timeline_ must be open to others' perspectives and accepting that someone else just knows more about a certain domain.
* _Reliability_ of sources drawn on when contributing to _The Timeline_. (Guidelines on this will be designed as per [issue #26](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/issues/26).)
* _Independence_ from political, financial or ideological pressure groups. This does not mean you are to be "apolitical" (the history of humanity is deeply political), but contributing with some political, financial or ideological agenda will raise concerns.
* _Open communication_ requires that discussions about the repository and published stories be maintained publicly. This is not to enforce full transparency. There will be cases where an author of a story might have got something "embarrassingly wrong" ([me](https://github.com/Ismael-KG)) and should be messaged privately. This is perfectly acceptable. (Changes are then tracked through the repository.) But the go-to method for discussing and improving stories is by opening [an issue](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/issues).
* _Duty of care_ is paramount. We are all here to learn from one another and that requires that we all feel safe and included in discussions, even when they do get heated. Kindness is key to the success of _A History of Research Ethics_.
* _Fairness_ is about treating all perspectives with the same due diligence. No perspective is automatically better than another, and adequate argumentation is necessary to overcome differences.
* _Sustainability_ of _The Timeline_ hinges on contributors being aware of this code of conduct and broader governance procedures. These are still underway (as per [issue #26](https://github.com/Ismael-KG/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/issues/26), so current contributors are partaking in a state of nature.
### Resolution: Reconciliation or Reprimand
_The Timeline_ is a private endeavour. There are no formal mechanisms for mediation, but personality clashes and unassailably divergent communication styles sometimes meet. The above eight principles will guide behaviours and be drawn on to establish whether an engagement is in good faith or crosses a line. However, whistleblowers and victims will always be taken seriously, and the principles will adjust if needed. Three approaches to conflicts between contributors are listed below:
1. The priority when handling relationships that have soured will be reconciliation. The key is that all contributors get on together. If, through dialogue, we can set our differences aside and move on in tandem, so it shall be!
2. When problems have gone too far, we can aim for tolerance; the parties shall need to learn to tolerate that the other is also a part of the project. However, the involved parties will be assigned different tasks to work on, so that encounters are kept to a minimum.
3. In the unfortunate case that a contributor posts unkind or unhelpful comments that clearly break with the eight principles, [they will be blocked](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/blocking-a-user-from-your-personal-account) after a discussion with [Ismael-KG](https://github.com/Ismael-KG) if they are deemed redeemable.

# Protocol 2: Contribution Types

# Protocol 3: Lifecycle of a Story

# Protocol 4: Style Guide
This protocol is intended for stories to adhere to some loose rules. By writing stories following the below, they can fit into a more consistent whole.
## All stories must have
* A short title
* An introductory line with less than 240 characters.
* A summary paragraph at the start (an "abstract") to excite readers but also keep people from wasting their time if a text is not that relevant;
* At least one paragraph on basic historical context (e.g.: "the events took place as eugenics were gaining traction across the pond...");
* A clear message for researchers and/or research governance folk (e.g.: "we here see the importance of including perspectives from groups who have been historically marginalised from academia").

### Titles
Story titles must be under 70 characters and conform to one of the following styles (or result in an issue to expand this list if they do not meet these guidelines):
* Simple name of the institution or technology being discussed (e.g. [_A Bablylonian Library_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443368!) and [_The Lunisolar Calendar_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16475774!)).
* The name of texts without clear authors (e.g. [_Edwin Smith Surgical Papyrus_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16456093!), [_Ebers Papyrus_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16457367!)).
* Books and papers with clear authors will be called "[book title], by [author's full name, or surnames if two authors, or "first author surname et al." if more than two authors]" (e.g. [_Hind Swaraj, by Mahatma Gandhi_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443706!), [_The Principles of Humane Experimental Technique, by Russell and Burch_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443919!)).
* Titles of the coined terms theme (#3) will be called "[author's full name, or surnames if two authors, or "first author surname et al." if more than two authors] coin(s) ["coined term"]" (e.g. [_Émile Durkheim coins "collective consciousness"_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16554598!), [_Molyneux et al. coin "neglected tropical diseases"_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16638090!)
* Titles in the "Legislation [...]" category (#11) will be the name of the text being analysed (e.g.: [_Code of Hamurabi_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16462371!), [_The Belmont Report_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16444358!)).
* Stories in the research tragedies category (#13) will be titled by "[common plot], Part [Roman numbers, I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII...]" (e.g. [_Heliocentrism, Part I_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443483!)).

### Introductory lines
These are very short, are to be kept under 240 characters, and should:
* Introduce the main event, and/or
* Introduce the concept that is relevant to ethics.

A case with both points is found in [Princess Dashkova's story](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16575859!):
> Princess Dashkova Yekaterina Romanovna Vorontsova is appointed to direct the Petersburg Academy of Arts and Sciences, establishes the Russian Academy, and helps reflect on gender stereotypes and allyship.

But both points needn't be present, as 240 characters is a tight limit. The event is, for example, the only element present in the case of [_Comptes Rendus_](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443638!):

> Following some, perhaps unpleasant, exchanges with journalists, "Comptes Rendus" becomes the French Académie's academic journal.

A story's intro that emphasises only the second point can be found in the [Humboldt University](https://www.tiki-toki.com/timeline/entry/1753034/A-History-of-Research-Ethics/#vars!panel=16443616!) story:
> "Academic freedom" gains form in Humboldt’s University of Berlin, in Germany.

### Abstracts
Must include at least one sentence on:
* Sociohistorical context;
* The event the story will study; and
* The key ethical question that the story raises.

### Historical Context and clear message
This is really the body of the story, and the following "structures" subsection provides some guidance.

## Structures
The basic structure for all stories to follow:
1. The **historical scene** must be set to absorb the reader into this different world, whether it be a year or a thousand years earlier. Sociohistorical context means answering to where, when and why the event took place.
2. **The event itself** must respond to _what_ and _how_. _What_ requires a description of the particular event. _How_ means engaging with the continuous nature of, well, time.
3. The scene is set for an **Ethical Quandary™️**. It is here where different [_dramatic structures_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure) might be employed. Is it all smooth-sailing until **panic**! A nefarious application of some technology! Or, perhaps the quandary section begins with sorrow and woe — unforgettable pain or untenable obstacles — and we gradually come to see the light. **The point is** that we can draw on some degree of theatricality. This is both (i) so that the narrative is captivating and (ii) that the very palpable distresses that complex ethical questions can come to cause are made as salient as possible. (Think Hacking's [1996](https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198524021.003.0012) "sensationalism.)
4. The **conclusion** must outline either (i) key ethical concepts gained from (3) above, (ii) questions for researchers to reflect on in their work, and/or (iii) thoughts for research governance folk to draw on when designing or reviewing policies. Ideally, the conclusion is _not_ a summary of (1), (2) and (3), as we might find in an academic philosophy paper.

## Intended Audiences
The potential audience of _A History of Research Ethics_ is formed by:
* **People who want to learn more about research ethics or the history of science.** For these audiences, who do not need to be experts in any particular field, make sure that titles are short and clear, that the intro line describes the importance of the story, and that the abstract (first paragraph) is clear as to what the event entailed and why it carries "ethical significance."
* **Research governance folk**, such as legal teams, policy makers, and even human resources departments. This audience requires that the timeline not ignore the important role of legal frameworks and legal literature in shaping modern research ethics. This audience also requires that the very diverse parties who influence the implementation of research governance -- more or less wittingly -- have their voices heard. "Technical accuracy" in describing scientific findings, for this audience, can be seen as less important than actionable guidance.
* **Researchers**, by which I mean the infinite range between master's students in theology and tenured professors in astrophysics.

## Communication style
Given the diverse audiences _The Timeline_ seeks to adapt to, the below guidelines emphasise the need to break down barriers.
* Prioritise simple terminology and explain any technical jargon _immediately_. By technical jargon, I mean terms used by a particular professions and which are hard for others to understand. (See what I did there?)
* Don't be afraid of trying to be funny. _A History of Research Ethics_ is not a dull academic journal that almost purposefully alienates anybody who isn't in the academics' club already. Humour breaks down barriers between writers and readers.
* On breaking down barriers, take readers on a journey with you. Learn together and speak in terms of "we." For example: "In this story, _we_ will visit the complexity of conducting research in environments where _we_ don't share the training that _our_ colleagues have" (roughly).
* The language employed can be informal. Feel free to use contractions, for example, and see Nordqist ([2020](https://www.thoughtco.com/informal-style-prose-1691170)) for more on informal language. But informality must not detract from clarity, or undermine the severity of stories or certain parts of stories. More formal tones can be employed when discussing more technical aspects of stories, either the ethical frameworks that they hint at, or any field-specific knowledge that might need spelling out.
